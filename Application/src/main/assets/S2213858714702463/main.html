            research centres in Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, France, Hungary,
            Italy, Mexico, Romania, and the USA. We enrolled patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes
            aged 18 years or older with proteinuria (urine protein:creatinine ratio [U<sub>PCR</sub>]
            500—5000 mg/g) and taking stable angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin
            receptor blockers, or both. We randomly assigned participants to atorvastatin 80 mg,
            rosuvastatin 10 mg, or rosuvastatin 40 mg for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was change
            from baseline to week 52 of mean U<sub>PCR</sub> in each treatment group. The study is

        <p class="normal">We enrolled 353 patients: 118 were assigned to rosuvastatin 10 mg, 124 to
            rosuvastatin 40 mg, and 111 to atorvastatin 80 mg; of these, 325 were included in the
            intention-to-treat population. U<sub>PCR</sub> baseline:week 52 ratio was 0·87 (95% CI
            0·77—0·99; p=0·033) with atorvastatin 80 mg, 1·02 (0·88—1·18; p=0·83) with rosuvastatin
            10 mg, and 0·96 (0·83—1·11; p=0·53) with rosuvastatin 40 mg. In a post-hoc analysis to
            compare statins, we combined data from PLANET I with those from PLANET II (a similar
            randomised parallel study of 237 patients with proteinuria but without diabetes;
            registered with <a class="ja50-ce-inter-ref" href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov"

            In this analysis, atorvastatin 80 mg lowered U<sub>PCR</sub> significantly more than did
            rosuvastatin 10 mg (−15·6%, 95% CI −28·3 to −0·5; p=0·043) and rosuvastatin 40 mg
            (−18·2%, −30·2 to −4·2; p=0·013). Adverse events occurred in 69 (60%) of 116 patients in
            the rosuvastatin 10 mg group versus 79 (64%) of 123 patients in the rosuvastatin 40 mg
            group versus 63 (57%) of 110 patients in the atorvastatin 80 mg group; renal events

        <p class="normal">Despite high-dose rosuvastatin lowering plasma lipid concentrations to a

    <p class="indent">Cholesterol is thought to be an important risk factor for loss of renal
        function. Experimental studies have shown that cholesterol might have a role in renal
        disease progression, and lowering cholesterol concentrations with statins has renoprotective
        effects.<a title="References" name="back-bib9" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer'"

        centres in Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, France, Hungary, Italy, Mexico,
        Romania, and the USA. During an 8-week lead-in period, patients with diabetes and
        proteinuria were given dietary advice and underwent optimisation of existing hypertension
        treatment and stopped taking statins (if applicable). Eligible patients were aged 18 years
        or older and had type 1 or type 2 diabetes with proteinuria (urine protein:urine creatinine
        [U<sub>PCR</sub>] 500—5000 mg/g), and fasting LDL cholesterol concentrations of 2·33 mmol/L
        or more. Patients had to be receiving treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme
        inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or both for at least 3 months before the first
        screening visit. 4 weeks before randomisation, blood pressure was rechecked and hypertension
        treatment adjusted accordingly. At the last visit before randomisation, U<sub>PCR</sub> was
        assessed for eligibility from first morning-void urine collected on 3 consecutive days.</p>

    <p class="indent">Patients were excluded if their HbA<sub>1c</sub> was greater than 11%; they
        had a history of statin intolerance, statin-induced myopathy, or serious hypersensitivity
        reaction to other statins; or they had a history of homozygous familial
        hypercholesterolaemia or known type 3 hyperlipoproteinaemia (familial
        dysbetalipoproteinaemia). They were also excluded if they had used oral or intravenous
        immunosuppressive drugs for treatment of proteinuria or renal disease or both within 3
        months of the first screening visit, because immunosuppressive drugs might affect
        proteinuria and confound its assessment. Additional exclusion criteria were current active
        liver disease (alanine aminotransferase increased by more than twice the upper limit of
        normal) or severe hepatic impairment; unexplained creatine kinase concentration more than
        twice the upper limit of normal; an ischaemic cardiovascular event within the past 12 weeks;
        moderate to severe congestive heart failure; hypothyroidism; Asian ethnic origin; severe
        renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;40 mL/min per 1·73

    <p class="indent">This trial was done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good
        Clinical Practice guidelines. Ethics committees and institutional review boards approved the

        Global Randomisation System software (AstraZeneca) before inclusion of the first patient.
        Patients and all study personnel (except the safety monitoring committee) were masked to
        treatment allocation. All study drugs were in identical capsules, and supplied in identical

    <p class="indent">Sample size was based on the primary outcome in each treatment group. We used
        a two-sided significance level of 5% to test for a positive effect versus baseline. We used
        a coefficient of variation of 75% as a conservative estimate of variability. Assuming a
        treatment ratio (U<sub>PCR</sub> on-treatment:U<sub>PCR</sub> at baseline) of 0·80 (a 20%
        reduction) and a coefficient of variation of 75%, roughly 97 evaluable patients per group
        were needed to show an effect with 90% power. The study was not powered to assess
        between-group comparisons; these analyses were prespecified as exploratory.</p>

    <p class="indent">The intention-to-treat population consisted of all patients with a baseline
        measure and at least one post-baseline measure for the primary efficacy variable who had
        taken at least one dose of study drug. We assessed urine proteins by calculating the
        geometric mean concentration from the three first morning voids at each evaluation
        timepoint. We determined baseline values from readings taken at the third visit (week −1).
        The data were log transformed.</p>

    <p class="indent">We assessed the primary outcome with a paired <i>t</i> test, done separately
        for each treatment group. We exponentiated results and present them as a mean ratio
        (on-treatment:baseline). We did similar analyses at other times for U<sub>PCR</sub>, U<sub>ACR</sub>,
        and untransformed eGFR data.</p>

    <p class="indent">We did prespecified exploratory analyses with ANCOVA and mixed-effects
        repeated-measure analyses that included treatment, region, and baseline value as a
        covariate. We did not adjust for multiplicity.</p>

    <p class="indent">We present descriptive statistics for percentage changes of lipids and
        lipoproteins from baseline to week 52 (or last observation carried forward) for each
        treatment group, for which baseline values were the mean value of the available readings
        from week −1 and week 0 (for lipids), or the reading from week 0 (for ApoB and ApoA1). As
        prespecified in the statistical analysis plan, we used ANOVA to compare percentage changes
        in each lipid and lipoprotein parameter in the rosuvastatin 40 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg
        groups. We included factors for treatment and region in the model. Adjusted means were
        weighted by region.</p>

    <p class="indent">We analysed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study
        drug. We present data for all reported adverse events, including those affecting the
        kidneys, irrespective of the investigator's assessment of causality. Statistical tests for

        creatinine). We also tested between-group differences in U<sub>PCR</sub>. With the present
        findings for the variability in proteinuria, we calculated post-hoc that 384 patients (128
        patients per treatment group) would provide 80% power to detect a 20% difference between the

    <p class="indent">The PLANET I study showed that urinary protein excretion was reduced during 1
        year of treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg, with no significant changes in eGFR in patients
        with diabetes and proteinuria. In patients given rosuvastatin 40 mg, urinary protein
        excretion was not significantly different from baseline, but the patients did have a
        significant decrease from baseline in eGFR, and doubling of serum creatinine and acute renal
        failure were more common in this group. Although the study was not powered for a direct
        comparison between the two statins, results of both PLANET I and II suggest that
        atorvastatin and rosuvastatin have different renal profiles in patients with proteinuria,
        whereas the effects on lipids are similar, with a larger effect of rosuvastatin 40 mg than
        of atorvastatin 80 mg.</p>

        One crucial question emanating from the results of these studies and the PLANET studies is
        whether different statins have different effects on progression of loss of renal function
        (and whether any variable effects on renal function are related or unrelated to their
        effects on lipids). Unfortunately, no trials with hard outcomes have been done that directly
        compare renal effects of two statins in these patient populations.</p>

    <p class="indent">The PLANET studies assessed two different statins. However, comparison between
        the statins was exploratory because the studies were designed and powered to estimate
        within-group effects. Thus, these comparisons between atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, or
        between the two rosuvastatin doses, should be interpreted with caution. The two statins
        should be compared in a predefined, adequately powered study before any firm conclusions can
        be drawn about difference in renal effects of the two statins.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, if our findings do indicate a true difference between the statins,
        the question remains: is atorvastatin renoprotective and rosuvastatin neutral, is
        atorvastatin neutral and rosuvastatin harmful, or is atorvastatin protective and
        rosuvastatin harmful? Because we did not include a placebo control in the present study, no
        definitive conclusions can be drawn in this regard. The change of eGFR in the atorvastatin
        80 mg group was small in patients with diabetes, which could suggest a protective effect of
        atorvastatin. What evidence is available in the published work that atorvastatin is
        renoprotective? In the TNT trial, atorvastatin 80 mg was reported to improve eGFR over a
        5-year period in patients with coronary heart disease and renal insufficiency (15% with
        diabetes), compared with a 10 mg dose.<a title="References" name="back-bib19"

    <p class="indent">As noted earlier, inclusion of a placebo group in our trials would have helped
        us to assess whether these two statins protect or harm the kidney. However, a placebo group
        was deemed unethical: the ethics committees questioned whether withholding statin treatment
        from patients with nephropathy was justified. Thus, such trials will probably never be done.
        This situation is particularly unfortunate because such a trial with hard outcomes is needed
        to verify whether or not there is a difference between statins (<a title="" href="#box1"

            <p class="indent">Before the start of the study in 2006, we searched PubMed for clinical
                trials published in English, with the keywords “albuminuria” or “proteinuria,”
                “rosuvastatin” and “atorvastatin”, and “diabetes”. We identified one study<a
                        title="References" name="back-bib27"
                        onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer'" onfocus="this.blur();"
                        onclick="showPopupMulti('bib27');"><sup>27</sup></a> of albuminuria and
                estimated glomerular filtration rate in 344 patients, of whom 293 had normal
                albuminuria excretion. The results showed no changes in either albuminuria or
                estimated glomerular filtration rate during 16 weeks of treatment with either
                rosuvastatin or atorvastatin. We found no randomised trials done in patient
                subgroups with higher levels of proteinuria. Using the same search strategy in
                November, 2014, we found two other articles, neither of which reported renal
                outcomes.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

            <p class="indent">In PLANET I, we studied the effect of 1 year of treatment with two
                commonly used statins—atorvastatin and rosuvastatin—on proteinuria and estimated
                glomerular filtration rate in patients with diabetes and nephropathy. To our
                knowledge, this study is the first that compares two statins in this high-risk
                population. We showed a fall in proteinuria with atorvastatin 80 mg associated with
                a stable estimated glomerular filtration rate, whereas rosuvastatin 40 mg had no
                effect on proteinuria and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate over the 1
                year of follow-up. Although our study was not powered for between-group comparisons,
                our findings suggest that despite high-dose rosuvastatin lowering lipid
                concentrations to a greater extent than high-dose atorvastatin, atorvastatin seems
                to have more renoprotective effects for this population. The study design prevents
                us unequivocally stating that some statins might harm the kidney. However, these
                data, and data from the SHARP trial<a title="ref4" name="back-bib11"

                (showing no renal protective effect of simvastatin and ezetimibe), warrant further
                clinical studies directly comparing atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, and possibly
                other statins, particularly in high renal risk groups. Statins seem to be effective
                in protecting many patients against cardiovascular events, but whether this benefit
                occurs at the expense of the kidneys needs to be established.</p></div>
    </div>
    <p class="indent">There are further limitations of the PLANET studies. The analysis of the
        primary outcome involved uncontrolled comparisons with baseline, which are subject to
        confounding with factors correlated with time, particularly the natural progression of
        disease. We used surrogate markers rather than hard clinical outcomes for our primary and
        secondary analyses (although in the safety analysis, the non-adjudicated,
        investigator-reported hard renal outcome of renal failure was more common in the
        rosuvastatin 40 mg, whereas death was more common in the rosuvastatin 10 mg group). The
        Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation for eGFR has not been validated for patients
        with mildly or moderately diminished renal function (most patients in the PLANET studies),
        nor did we use a more accurate measure such as measured GFR.<a title="References"
                                                                       name="back-bib29"

        Finally, we did several statistical tests, with no adjustment for multiple comparisons.</p>

    <p class="indent">The PLANET studies are among the first to investigate the effects of two
        different statins on renal outcomes, offering a start to understanding the potential
        heterogeneity of the effects of statins on the kidney. We recommend future studies with
        sufficiently large groups of patients with proteinuria to directly compare the effects of
        different statins on both renal surrogate markers, such as proteinuria, and hard-outcome
        markers, such as end-stage renal disease.</p>
